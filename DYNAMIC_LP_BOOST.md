# Dynamic LP Boost System

## Overview
The LP (Liquidity Provider) boost automatically adjusts based on the number of active Pendle markets, incentivizing liquidity in the remaining active markets when others mature.

## Implementation Date
Implemented: October 21, 2025

## How It Works

### LP Boost Rules
- **Multiple Active Markets (2+)**: LP receives **1.25x** boost
- **Single Active Market (1)**: LP receives **1.5x** boost
- **Matured Markets**: LP receives **0x** boost (no points)

### Example Timeline

#### Before October 23, 2025 (Both Markets Active)
```
üìÖ October 23, 2025 Market - Active
LP Oct 23: $5.0M ‚Üí 1.25x Boost ‚Üí Points earned ‚úÖ

üìÖ December 11, 2025 Market - Active
LP Dec 11: $3.0M ‚Üí 1.25x Boost ‚Üí Points earned ‚úÖ

Active Markets: 2
LP Boost: 1.25x
```

#### After October 23, 2025 (Only December 11 Active)
```
üìÖ October 23, 2025 Market - ‚ö†Ô∏è MATURED
LP Oct 23: $5.0M (Locked) ‚Üí 0x ‚Üí No points ‚ùå

üìÖ December 11, 2025 Market - Active
LP Dec 11: $3.0M ‚Üí 1.5x Boost ‚Üí Points earned ‚úÖ (INCREASED!)

Active Markets: 1
LP Boost: 1.5x (AUTOMATIC INCREASE)
```

## Why This Matters

### Incentive Structure
1. **Early Stage**: When multiple markets are active, LP earns 1.25x
2. **Late Stage**: When only one market remains, LP earns 1.5x
3. **Post-Maturity**: Users are incentivized to migrate and provide liquidity to the active market

### Benefits
- ‚úÖ Rewards loyal LPs who stay in active markets
- ‚úÖ Maintains liquidity depth as markets mature
- ‚úÖ Automatic adjustment (no manual intervention needed)
- ‚úÖ Transparent and predictable boost changes

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `api.js`
**Changes:**
- Added `lpSingleMarket: 1.5` to `ALMANAK_POINTS_CONFIG.boosts`
- Updated `calculateWeightedTvl()` to:
  - Count active markets
  - Apply dynamic LP boost based on count
  - Log boost decisions for transparency
- Return `lpBoost` value for each market in weighted TVL object

**Key Logic:**
```javascript
// Count active markets (not matured)
const activeMarketsCount = (isOct23Matured ? 0 : 1) + (isDec11Matured ? 0 : 1);

// Apply appropriate boost
const lpBoostMultiplier = activeMarketsCount === 1 
    ? ALMANAK_POINTS_CONFIG.boosts.lpSingleMarket  // 1.5x
    : ALMANAK_POINTS_CONFIG.boosts.lp;             // 1.25x
```

#### 2. `main.js`
**Changes:**
- Updated TVL breakdown table to display dynamic boost
- Changed hardcoded "1.25x Boost" to `weighted.oct23.lpBoost + 'x Boost'`
- Changed hardcoded "1.25x" multiplier to `weighted.oct23.lpBoost + 'x'`
- Applied same changes for December 11 market
- Updated combined LP row to show active market's boost

#### 3. `index.html`
**Changes:**
- Added CSS class for `boost-1-5x` badge with blue styling
- Maintains visual distinction between boost levels:
  - 5x: Green (YT)
  - 1.5x: Blue (LP single market)
  - 1.25x: Yellow (LP multiple markets)
  - 1x: Gray (Other TVL)

## Points Calculation Example

### Scenario: After October 23 Matured

**TVL Distribution:**
- October 23 LP (Matured): $5.0M ‚Üí 0x ‚Üí $0 weighted TVL
- December 11 LP (Active): $3.0M ‚Üí 1.5x ‚Üí $4.5M weighted TVL
- Total Weighted TVL: $20M (example)

**Daily Points for December 11 LP:**
- LP Share: $4.5M / $20M = 22.5%
- Daily Points: 316,666 √ó 22.5% = **71,250 points/day**

**Comparison with 1.25x:**
- If still 1.25x: $3.0M √ó 1.25 = $3.75M weighted
- Daily Points: 316,666 √ó ($3.75M / $20M) = 59,375 points/day
- **Increase: +20% more points with 1.5x boost!**

## User Experience

### What Users See

#### Before Maturity (1.25x)
```
LP Dec 11: $3.0M   |   1.25x   |   $3.75M   |   59,375 pts/day
```

#### After Maturity (1.5x)
```
LP Dec 11: $3.0M   |   1.5x   |   $4.5M   |   71,250 pts/day
```

The boost badge color changes from yellow (1.25x) to blue (1.5x) automatically.

### Console Logging
For transparency, the system logs boost decisions:
```
üéØ LP Boost Calculation:
  activeMarkets: 1
  oct23Matured: true
  dec11Matured: false
  lpBoostApplied: 1.5x
```

## Future Considerations

### Adding More Markets
When new markets are added:
- If 2+ markets are active: All use 1.25x LP boost
- When only 1 remains: That market gets 1.5x LP boost
- System automatically adjusts without code changes

### Potential Extensions
- Could add 2x boost when market is within last 7 days before maturity
- Could add graduated boosts based on TVL thresholds
- Could add time-based boosts during specific periods

## Testing

To verify dynamic boost is working:

1. **Check Current Status** (Both Markets Active):
   - Open the calculator
   - Check TVL table
   - Both markets should show 1.25x LP boost
   - Check console for: `lpBoostApplied: 1.25x`

2. **Simulate One Market Matured**:
   - Temporarily change October 23 maturity to past date in `PENDLE_CONFIG`
   - Refresh page
   - December 11 market should show 1.5x LP boost
   - October 23 should show 0x (Matured)
   - Check console for: `lpBoostApplied: 1.5x`

3. **Verify Points Calculation**:
   - Calculate expected daily points with 1.5x
   - Compare with displayed points
   - Should match the increased boost

## Summary

The dynamic LP boost system ensures that:
1. ‚úÖ Liquidity is incentivized in active markets
2. ‚úÖ Users are rewarded for staying in the last active market
3. ‚úÖ The transition is automatic and transparent
4. ‚úÖ Points calculations remain fair and consistent

This creates a better user experience and maintains protocol health as markets naturally mature over time.
