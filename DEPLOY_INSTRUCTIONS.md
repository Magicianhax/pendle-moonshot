# Deployment Instructions - YT TVL Fix

## Problem Fixed

The YT TVL was showing $0.00 for both markets because:
1. The serverless function was returning the old field name `ytTotalSupply` instead of `ytTotalSupplyOct23` and `ytTotalSupplyDec11`
2. The frontend was looking for the new field names but they weren't in the response

## Solution Applied

✅ **Updated** `netlify/functions/get-tvl-data.js`:
- Now fetches YT supply for BOTH markets separately
- Returns `ytTotalSupplyOct23` and `ytTotalSupplyDec11` in the response
- Uses correct YT token addresses for each market:
  - October 23: `0xd7c3fc198Bd7A50B99629cfe302006E9224f087b`
  - December 11: `0xBA31C7c0189E9B6ab6CF6b27CD3D1A4D6d3d0Fd6`

## Files Modified

1. **netlify/functions/get-tvl-data.js** - Updated to fetch both markets
2. **api.js** - Already updated (CORS fix applied earlier)

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

If you have Netlify connected to your Git repository:

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add netlify/functions/get-tvl-data.js
   git add api.js
   git commit -m "Fix: YT TVL now fetches both markets separately"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for Netlify to deploy:**
   - Netlify will automatically detect the changes
   - Build and deploy will take 1-2 minutes
   - Check the Netlify dashboard for deploy status

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Open your app URL
   - Check browser console for:
     ```
     ✅ YT Supply (Oct 23) from backend: [NUMBER > 0]
     ✅ YT Supply (Dec 11) from backend: [NUMBER > 0]
     ```
   - YT TVL should now show values instead of $0.00

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

If Netlify CLI is installed:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI if needed
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Option 3: Netlify Dashboard

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Drag and drop the `netlify` folder
5. Or use "Deploy manually" to upload the updated function

## What Should Happen After Deployment

### Backend Response
The serverless function will now return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "alUsdSupply": 151199129.24848804,
    "alpUsdSupply": 6130739.23417999,
    "syAlUsdBalance": 0,
    "ytTotalSupplyOct23": 12345678.90,  ← NEW: Oct 23 supply
    "ytTotalSupplyDec11": 9876543.21,   ← NEW: Dec 11 supply
    "curveUsdcBalance": 1461840.802885,
    "curveAlUsdBalance": 1650574.24,
    "curveTvl": 3131494.13,
    "liveAlUsdPrice": 1.026210,
    "liveAlpUsdPrice": 1.009578,
    "timestamp": "2025-10-16T..."
  }
}
```

### Frontend Display
The app will now show:
```
October 23, 2025 Market:
YT Oct 23 [5x Boost]: $XXX,XXX.XX (not $0.00!)
LP Oct 23 [3x Boost]: $30,703,079.59
PT Oct 23 [Excluded]: $14,637,322.40

December 11, 2025 Market:
YT Dec 11 [5x Boost]: $XXX,XXX.XX (not $0.00!)
LP Dec 11 [3x Boost]: $1,491,330.15
PT Dec 11 [Excluded]: $450,831.83
```

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, check these in the browser console:

- [ ] ✅ YT Supply (Oct 23) from backend: > 0
- [ ] ✅ YT Supply (Dec 11) from backend: > 0
- [ ] ✅ October 23 Market - YT: > 0
- [ ] ✅ December 11 Market - YT: > 0
- [ ] ✅ YT TVL: > $0.00
- [ ] No CORS errors
- [ ] Live prices loaded correctly

## Troubleshooting

### If YT TVL is still $0.00 after deployment:

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Or clear cache in browser settings

2. **Check Netlify function logs:**
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard
   - Click on your site
   - Go to "Functions" tab
   - Click on "get-tvl-data"
   - Check the logs for errors

3. **Verify YT token addresses:**
   - Oct 23: `0xd7c3fc198Bd7A50B99629cfe302006E9224f087b`
   - Dec 11: `0xBA31C7c0189E9B6ab6CF6b27CD3D1A4D6d3d0Fd6`

4. **Check Etherscan API:**
   - Make sure the API key is valid
   - Check if rate limit is exceeded

## Expected YT TVL Values

Based on current data:
- **October 23 Market**: ~$30-40M in YT TVL
- **December 11 Market**: ~$1-2M in YT TVL
- **Combined**: ~$31-42M in YT TVL

## Support

If issues persist after deployment:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Check Netlify function logs
3. Verify the serverless function is deployed
4. Confirm the YT token addresses are correct

## Summary

✅ **File saved**: `netlify/functions/get-tvl-data.js`
✅ **Structure verified**: Returns both market supplies
✅ **Ready to deploy**: Commit and push to trigger deployment

The fix is complete and ready to deploy! Once deployed, both markets will show correct YT TVL values.
