### 4. Backend Updates

#### API Functions (`api.js`)
- `calculateMoonshot(amount, marketKey)`: Accepts market selection
- `getAllMarketsData()`: Fetches data for both markets concurrently
- `fetchLiveAlUsdPrice()`: Fetches live alUSD price
- `fetchLiveAlpUsdPrice()`: Fetches live alpUSD price
- `getDaysToMaturity(marketKey)`: Returns days for selected market
- `calculateWeightedTvl(tvlData)`: Returns market-specific weighted TVL

#### Serverless Function (`get-tvl-data.js`)
- Fetches YT total supply for both markets
- Fetches live alUSD and alpUSD prices
- Calculates market-specific TVL data
- Returns structured data with `oct23` and `dec11` properties

#### Main Application (`main.js`)
- `initializeMarketData()`: Loads both markets on startup
- `switchMarket(market)`: Handles market selection
- `performCalculation(amount)`: Uses selected market for calculations
- `displayResults(results)`: Shows results for selected market
- `displayExistingYtResults(ytAmount, ytCost)`: Uses selected market data
- `updateCountdown()`: Updates both market countdowns
- `refreshMarketData()`: Refreshes both markets every 5 minutes

### 5. State Management

```javascript
let marketData = {
    selectedMarket: 'oct23', // 'oct23' or 'dec11'
    oct23: {
        underlyingApy: 0,
        impliedApy: 0,
        daysToMaturity: 0
    },
    dec11: {
        underlyingApy: 0,
        impliedApy: 0,
        daysToMaturity: 0
    },
    lastUpdated: null,
    tvlData: null,
    weightedTvl: null
};
```
